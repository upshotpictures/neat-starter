**Mind and Emotion or Emotion and Mind**<br><br>
What is the difference between the two?<br><br>
Do our emotions control our minds or do our minds control emotions?<br><br>
How do negative emotions and negative feelings impact upon us?<br>
What can we do about it?<br><br>
These are the crucial questions we are going to answer as we go through
this manual, especially when we come to talk about how negative emotions
and feelings can have such a debilitating and negative affect on us.
The Science of Emotion and Thought.<br><br>
We are going to look at some scientific facts that are continuing to emerge
from the world of neurology that show how the brain has plasticity and can
change at any stage of life. Brain Imaging techniques like MRI and CT scans
now show that memory is not contained in the higher regions of the brain as
was previously thought during the early part of the twentieth century by
pioneers like Freud and Jung. <br><br>Since the 1960s the technology has clearly
shown that memory is a system of convergence and divergence using many
parts of the brain at the same time and in particular the emotional brain
structures. In other words, when you "go back" to a memory, it in turn
"comes forward" to you and you then re-experience the memory with the
same emotion that was present when the memory was formed. This is
crucial to understanding the thought/emotion links in the brain.<br><br>
We will further see how it is entirely possible to have more control over your
emotions than was previously thought possible, especially when it comes to
the invasion of negative emotional flooding that leads to conditions like
anxiety, depression and the various forms of addiction.
