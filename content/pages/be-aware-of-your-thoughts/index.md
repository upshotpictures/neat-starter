title: BEWARE OF YOUR THOUGHTS
---
There is an old Chinese proverb <br>
“ Beware of your thoughts, they may come true. “
I am all for positive thinking. It does bring results and you are more likely to
achieve your goals if you apply positive thinking to your life.
However, before you start thinking positively you need to eliminate any
negative thinking. To do this you also need to make sure that your overall
way of thinking is not infused with negative emotions. Because what may
appear like positive thinking can actually be negative thinking if the
emotional emphasis is of a negative pattern.
